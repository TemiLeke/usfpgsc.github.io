To assist you with your preparations, please find a few [resources](https://usfpgsc.github.io/teaching/3mt_competition_guide/) that will help you in writing your presentation, creating your slide and practising your presentation.


## Drafting your presentation 

- Write for your audience
- Avoid jargon and academic language.
- Explain concepts and people important to your research – you may know all about Professor Smith’s theories, but your audience may not.
- Highlight the outcomes of your research, and the desired outcome.
- Imagine that you are explaining your research to a close friend or fellow student from another field.
- Convey your excitement and enthusiasm for your subject.


## Tell a story

- You may like to present your 3MT as a narrative, with a beginning, middle and end.
- It’s not easy to condense your research into three minutes, so you may find it easier to break your presentation down into smaller sections.
- Try writing an opener to catch the attention of the audience, then highlight your different points, 
and finally have a summary to restate the importance of your work

## Rules

Before you start work on your slide, you should take the following rules into account:

- One single static PowerPoint slide is permitted.
- No slide transitions, animations or ‘movement’ of any description are permitted.
- Your slide is to be presented from the beginning of your oration; and
- No additional electronic media (e.g., sound and video files) are permitted.
- If you need to reference a picture, image, or any kind of content in your slide, you can do it on the title page or at the bottom of the slide in a small box.
